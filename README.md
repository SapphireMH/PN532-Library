# PN532-Library
My IPASS project for controlling a PN532 chip over I2C and SPI

For documentation, usage instructions and examples check out the doxygen page.

Credits to:

⋅⋅* Adafruit industries for an excellent breakoutboard and clearing up some confusion i had about the datasheet by analyzing how their library worked.

⋅⋅* Wouter van ooijen for hwlib and its usage examples.

⋅⋅* The teachers and fellow students at school for support.
